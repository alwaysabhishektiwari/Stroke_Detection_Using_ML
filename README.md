🫀 Heart Stroke Prediction Using ML This project focuses on predicting the risk of heart stroke by training a machine learning model on medical and lifestyle data. The system analyzes key health parameters such as Age, Sex, BP, BMI, Smoking status, and other clinical factors to determine whether a person is at risk of experiencing a heart stroke.
